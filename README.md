# Key-insights 

First, I had to perform thorough data cleaning to ensure accuracy and reliability. Then, I moved on to data processing to extract key insights and trends. Finally, I used advanced data analysis techniques to visualize the data and create a user-friendly dashboard that provides valuable insights into Tejas Store's sales and customer behavior.
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in data cleaning, data processing, and data analysis techniques, as well as a deeper understanding of Tejas Store's business operations. I'm proud to have created a tool that will help Vrinda Store make informed decisions based on the data presented
